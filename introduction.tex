\frametitle{Background}
\begin{block}{}
A fundamental engineering challenge surrounding brittle materials is predicting failure. This involves predicting where fracture \textbf{nucleation} will occur as well as how these fractures \textbf{propagate}.
\newline
\newline
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to model the effects that cause nucleation and growth, but this is computationally intensive.

\frametitle{The Goal}
\begin{block}{}
The clinic aims to develop a model that rapidly predicts where fractures will form under different environmental conditions. These conditions include different types of stress and exposure to water.
\newline
\newline
We will do this by training a supervised \textbf{Machine Learning (ML)} algorithm on MD simulation data, and by creating a \textbf{graph theoretic description} of the material.
