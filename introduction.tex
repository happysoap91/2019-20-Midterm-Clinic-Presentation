\begin{block}{}
A fundamental engineering challenge surrounding brittle materials is predicting failure. This involves predicting where fractures \textbf{nucleate} as well as how these fractures \textbf{propagate}.
\newline
\newline
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to model the effects that cause nucleation and growth, but this is computationally intensive.

\frametitle{Motivation}
\begin{block}{}
The clinic aims to develop a model that rapidly predicts where fractures will form silica-based glasses. We consider different environmental conditions including different boundary properties exposure to water.
\newline
\newline
By creating a graph theoretic description of the material we will train a supervised \textbf{Machine Learning (ML)} algorithm on MD simulation data.

{\frametitle{Molecular Dynamics Simulations}
\begin{block}{}
Molecular dynamics (MD) methods simulate the system at the nanoscale and model the individual chemical and physical interactions taking place in the material.
\newline
\newline
These simulations have successfully predicted a wide range of detailed
properties that cannot be obtained with continuum methods, and that are
consistent with experimental observations.

\frametitle{LAMMPS}
\begin{block}{} 

Sandia has developed molecular dynamics simulation software Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator.

Simulations are generated using the LAMMPS code. Each LAMMPS run simulates a sample of SiO2 containing approximately 70,000 atoms.
